### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Automatic Monitor Launch

The main installer automatically starts the progress monitor:

```batch
start "TerraFusion Progress Monitor" cmd /k "INSTALLATION_PROGRESS_MONITOR.bat"
```

#### Process Detection

Monitor checks for active installation processes:

```batch
tasklist | findstr "node.exe" >nul
tasklist | findstr "cargo.exe" >nul
tasklist | findstr "docker.exe" >nul
```

#### Smart Timing

Different messages based on installation phase:

```batch
if %time_elapsed% LSS 300 (
    echo Early installation phase...
) else if %time_elapsed% LSS 1200 (
    echo Main installation in progress...
) else (
    echo Final compilation phase...
)
```
