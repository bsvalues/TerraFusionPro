## 📊 Communication Strategy

### Two-Window System

1. **Main Installer Window**: Shows primary installation steps
2. **Progress Monitor Window**: Provides real-time status updates

### Message Types

- **Status Updates**: What's happening now
- **Time Estimates**: How long each phase takes
- **Reassurance**: "This is normal" messages
- **Instructions**: What user should do
- **Completion**: Success confirmations

### Key Phrases Used

- "Installation is progressing normally..."
- "This step takes 15-25 minutes - perfect time for coffee!"
- "Please be patient, AI compilation is intensive..."
- "Almost there! Final steps in progress..."
- "Success! TerraFusion is ready to dominate!"

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Automatic Monitor Launch

The main installer automatically starts the progress monitor:

```batch
start "TerraFusion Progress Monitor" cmd /k "INSTALLATION_PROGRESS_MONITOR.bat"
```

### Process Detection

Monitor checks for active installation processes:

```batch
tasklist | findstr "node.exe" >nul
tasklist | findstr "cargo.exe" >nul
tasklist | findstr "docker.exe" >nul
```

### Smart Timing

Different messages based on installation phase:

```batch
if %time_elapsed% LSS 300 (
    echo Early installation phase...
) else if %time_elapsed% LSS 1200 (
    echo Main installation in progress...
) else (
    echo Final compilation phase...
)
```
