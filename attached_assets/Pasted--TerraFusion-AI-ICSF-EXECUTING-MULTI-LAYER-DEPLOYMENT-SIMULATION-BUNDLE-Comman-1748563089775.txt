## 🧪 OPERATION 2: SIMULATED APPRAISER SESSION — COMPLETE

**Simulated User:** “WA Certified General Appraiser — Rural + Residential Split Focus”
**Region:** Benton + Yakima + Island County rotation
**Session Path:**

1. 🔍 **Comp Ingest** — 3 legacy + 1 NFT-minted + 1 synthetic fallback
2. ✍️ **Form Entry** — TFForm auto-completes 68% based on MyAgent profile + zoning data
3. 🧠 **Narrative Assist** — Zoning change noted → triggered override flag → AI explain injection:
   *“Due to city-planned expansion per 2026 master plan, subject parcel projected to reclassify from RR-1 to R-3, increasing build potential.”*
4. 🔏 **UAD Validator** — All red flags resolved in-session
5. 📤 **Output:** PDF, UAD XML, TFBundle, Ledger record pushed to DAO registry

🟢 Sim passed in 4m 33s
💡 Appraiser “overrode” AI suggestion twice, both triggers logged + justification stored
