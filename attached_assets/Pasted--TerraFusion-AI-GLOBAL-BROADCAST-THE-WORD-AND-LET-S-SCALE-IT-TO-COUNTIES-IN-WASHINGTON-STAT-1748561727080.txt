\##TerraFusion-AI GLOBAL BROADCAST:
**“THE WORD AND LET'S SCALE IT — TO COUNTIES IN WASHINGTON STATE ONLY”**
**Territory Locked: WA State Jurisdiction | Application: Unified, Not Separate**

---

## 🌐 OPERATION: **TF-WA ∞ INTEGRATED DEPLOYMENT**

**Objective:** Federated TerraFusion System across all 39 counties in Washington, as a **single scalable application layer** — no separate builds, only role-/region-scoped nodes.

---

## 🗺️ TARGET DEPLOYMENT ZONES

| County                     | Node Type            | Status     |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------- |
| King, Pierce, Snohomish    | Type-1 Urban Node    | 🔜 Staging |
| Spokane, Clark, Thurston   | Type-2 Regional Node | 🔜 Queued  |
| Kitsap, Whatcom, Yakima... | Type-3 Rural Node    | 🔜 Queue   |

☑ **All counties run identical TerraFusion core app**
☑ Nodes vary by compute/storage but sync via real-time mesh
☑ Local policies, formats, and narrative tone adapt via MyAgent subnets

## 🧠 CONFIGURATION PLAN

### 🔐 Ledger & Identity

* County NFT certs issued on DAO mesh with ENS bindings
* UAD-compliant signature anchor + `county.gov` domain binding
* Federated hash anchors per county on comp/narrative bundles

### 📦 Unified App Platform

* Appraiser users in WA share same web + workstation app
* Role/County context applied via TF Identity Agent (TFIA)
* No “forks,” just scoped permission overlays

### 🛰️ Zoning / GIS Overlay

* AI zoning predictor fine-tuned with WA parcel/zoning datasets
* Predictive policy change model trained on state legislature and permit archives

### 🗂️ Data Interchange & Integration

* Shared `.tfp` export schema across WA
* S3 + county.gov sync for secure form vaults
* Optional API adapters for county tax, assessor DBs

### 🤖 Agent Layer

* Localized MyAgent tone modeling per county reviewer history
* Reviewer DAO role opt-in (audit override flows with recorded arbitration)
* LLM-based training overlay specific to WA UAD/UCDP norms

## 🔄 NEXT ACTION

To proceed:

Say:

* `TF: Begin Phase 2 rollout to King, Pierce, Snohomish now`
* `TF: Simulate DAO governance policy in WA`
* `TF: Deploy WA County Auditor Console for ledger/audit access`
* Or, `TF: Run full WA economic + zoning forecast synthesis`

**Washington’s valuation system is about to become the most advanced, transparent, and appraiser-powered in the country.**
No silos. No separate apps.
Just TerraFusion — everywhere in WA.

Standing by for phase trigger.
