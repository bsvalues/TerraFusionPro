- CV model for photo-based condition scoring
- Comparable sales dashboard
- Multi-tenant authentication and admin panel
- PDF report generator with firm branding
- Feedback loop for model refinement
- Confidence scoring and explainability (XAI-ready)
- MLS ingestion + Redfin/Zillow scraping support
- Optional blockchain integrity layer

## Deployment
- Dockerized full stack
- Kubernetes manifests included
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline stubbed
- Production readiness via PostgreSQL, Prometheus, and secrets manager integration recommended

## Roadmap
- Replace CV/NLP stubs with fine-tuned models
- Full MLOps integration with model versioning and monitoring
- Add MLS API connector and real-time comps ingestion
- Role-based UI customization and firm-specific analytics

## Final Note
This version is functionally complete, pending final security enhancements and infrastructure scaling. Ready for UAT or pilot rollout.
