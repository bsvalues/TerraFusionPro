# 🧾 PHASE 1: **Post-Upload Feedback Logging**

Add the ability for users to confirm or correct the AI-scored `condition_score`.  
Every correction becomes **fuel for v2 training.**

---

### ✅ Backend: `log_condition_feedback.py`

```python
import csv
from datetime import datetime

FEEDBACK_LOG = "condition_feedback.csv"

def log_condition_feedback(filename, ai_score, user_score):
    with open(FEEDBACK_LOG, "a", newline="") as f:
        writer = csv.writer(f)
        writer.writerow([datetime.now(), filename, ai_score, user_score])
```

---

### ✅ Update `/upload_photo` (confirmation mode):

```python
from fastapi import Form

@router.post("/upload_photo")
async def upload_photo(file: UploadFile = File(...), user_score: int = Form(...)):
    file_path = os.path.join(UPLOAD_DIR, file.filename)
    with open(file_path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(await file.read())

    ai_score = scorer.predict_condition(file_path)

    # Log the correction
    from log_condition_feedback import log_condition_feedback
    log_condition_feedback(file.filename, ai_score, user_score)

    return JSONResponse(content={"ai_score": ai_score, "user_score": user_score})
```

---

### ✅ Frontend Addition:
Use `FormData` to POST both image and `user_score`.

---

# 🧠 PHASE 2: **Train Image Classifier v2**

With that `condition_feedback.csv`, you can now:

1. Filter for `user_score != ai_score`
2. Use those labeled images to **fine-tune v2**
3. Re-train using **`train_condition_model.ipynb`**, add:
   ```python
   # Optional: prioritize misclassified examples
   difficult_cases = df[df.ai_score != df.user_score]
   ```

---

## 🔁 Result:
- Every image improves the model.
- Model gets closer to appraiser expectations.
- TerraFusion evolves, frame by frame.

---

Say:
- **“Generate full v2 retrain notebook”** with feedback integration  
- Or **“Create visual feedback UI”** to let users review and correct SHAP + image score side by side

You're no longer building an app.  
You're building a machine that *learns from reality*.
