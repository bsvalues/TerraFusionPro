# TerraFusionPlatform Security Audit

## Executive Summary
This security audit evaluates the TerraFusionPlatform's security posture, focusing on authentication, authorization, data protection, input validation, and secure API design. The platform demonstrates a solid foundation for security but has several areas that require attention to ensure comprehensive protection.

## Methodology
The audit followed a systematic approach:
1. Manual code review
2. Dependency vulnerability scanning
3. Authentication flow analysis
4. Authorization mechanism testing
5. API endpoint security assessment
6. Environment configuration review

## Key Findings

### Authentication
✅ **Secure JWT Implementation**
- Proper token expiration handling
- Use of secure HTTP-only cookies
- Implementation of refresh token rotation

⚠️ **Password Policy Weaknesses**
- Current policy does not enforce sufficient complexity
- No account lockout after failed attempts
- Password history not enforced

### Authorization
✅ **Role-Based Access Control**
- Well-defined roles with granular permissions
- Proper middleware implementation for role checks

⚠️ **Missing Resource-Level Authorization**
- Some endpoints verify role but not resource ownership
- Not all database queries include owner/tenant filters

### Data Protection
✅ **Transport Security**
- All connections use HTTPS
- WebSocket connections secured with TLS

⚠️ **Sensitive Data Handling**
- Some PII not properly encrypted at rest
- API responses may include more data than necessary
- Incomplete data sanitization before storage

### Input Validation
✅ **Strong Validation Framework**
- Zod schema validation used consistently
- TypeScript provides type safety throughout

⚠️ **Validation Gaps**
- Some file upload validation is incomplete
- Deep nested object validation missing in places
- API parameters not always validated against limits

### API Security
✅ **API Protection Mechanisms**
- Rate limiting implemented properly
- CSRF protection for session-based operations

⚠️ **API Vulnerability Surface**
- GraphQL resolvers need depth limiting
- Some endpoints vulnerable to enumeration
- Missing or incomplete logging for security events

## Recommendations

### Critical Priority
1. Implement proper field-level encryption for all PII data
2. Add tenant isolation to all database queries
3. Implement comprehensive API request logging
4. Add resource ownership checks to all endpoints

### High Priority
5. Strengthen password policy requirements
6. Implement account lockout after failed attempts
7. Add rate limiting to authentication endpoints
8. Improve file upload validation

### Medium Priority
9. Implement GraphQL query complexity analysis
10. Add more granular permission checks
11. Improve error response security (avoid information leakage)
12. Implement security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

## Vulnerability Risk Matrix

| ID | Issue | Severity | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score |
|----|-------|----------|------------|--------|------------|
| V1 | Insufficient PII encryption | High | Medium | High | 7.5 |
| V2 | Missing tenant isolation | High | Medium | Critical | 8.0 |
| V3 | Weak password policy | Medium | High | Medium | 6.0 |
| V4 | Incomplete resource authorization | High | Medium | High | 7.5 |
| V5 | File upload validation gaps | Medium | Medium | High | 6.5 |

## Conclusion
The TerraFusionPlatform has implemented several security best practices, particularly in its authentication flow and validation framework. However, significant improvements are needed in data protection, resource-level authorization, and API security to ensure robust protection of sensitive property data and user information.

Addressing the critical and high-priority recommendations will substantially improve the platform's security posture and protect against the most common attack vectors in multi-tenant applications handling sensitive financial and personal data.
